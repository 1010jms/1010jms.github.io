## Introduction

Throughout the first two weeks of the course "ICS 314: Introduction to Software Engineering," the class has been quickly going through the basics of the programming language Javascript through a pedagogy known as "Athletic Software Engineering (ASE)." This essay describes my experience learning Javascript both before and during this course, and it also briefly describes what ASE is, how ASE is implemented in ICS 314, and what my personal opinions are regarding this style of learning.
