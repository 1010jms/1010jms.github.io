## Introduction

One phrase that I have constantly heard throughout my life is: "there is no such thing as a stupid question," and while I believe that is true, I also believe that a question can be asked in a way that can make it look like a stupid question. This sentiment is loosely shown in Eric Raymond's [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). In his essay, Raymond lists out some of the qualifications that must be met in order for any software developer to ask questions the "smart" way. The rest of this essay will focus on two questions found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), a question-and-answer website built specifically for programmers: a "smart" question that resulted in a "smart" answer, and a "not smart" question that resulted in a condescending answer.
