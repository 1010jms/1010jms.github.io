## Introduction
In the past two weeks, I had to relearn a coding skill that I have not used in a very, very long time: constructing a proper web page from scratch. When it comes to developing web pages, the only experience I had was one class I took back in 7th grade where the work was entirely based in HTML,so not only did I have to dust off whatever HTML-related experience I retained from that class, but I also had to quickly familiarize myself with how CSS works, and I also had to get familiar with the concept of a UI framework by using the Semantic UI framework. Fortunately, relearning HTML and learning CSS was a fairly quick and simple process; unfortunately, the same cannot be said about incorporating Semantic UI into the HTML/CSS code.
