## Introduction
In the past two weeks, I had to relearn a coding skill that I have not used in a very, very long time: constructing a proper web page from scratch. When it comes to developing web pages, the only experience I had was one class I took back in 7th grade where the work was entirely based in HTML,so not only did I have to dust off whatever HTML-related experience I retained from that class, but I also had to quickly familiarize myself with how CSS works, and I also had to get familiar with the concept of a UI framework by using the Semantic UI framework. Fortunately, relearning HTML and learning CSS was a fairly quick and simple process; unfortunately, the same cannot be said about incorporating Semantic UI into the HTML/CSS code.

## The Semantic Struggle is Real
Trying to learn Semantic UI while simultaneously learning HTML and CSS has been a frequent struggle, but I will admit that a majority of that struggle came from the fact that I have not gone through a proper tutorial covering the semantics of Semantic UI - a problem that I hope to remedy sometime in the near future. Since I have not built my Semantic UI knowledge on a solid foundation, I had a very difficult time trying to find the right key words to use in order to properly implement a Semantic UI function, and this struggle to find the right Semantic UI key words made it difficult for me to remember some the the key words needed for certain functions in HTML and CSS. While Semantic UI has caused a bit of a struggle so far, once the key words are memorized and more experience is gained, I have no doubt that Semantic UI will make creating web pages a lot faster with a lot less writing.
